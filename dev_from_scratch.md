Become a Developer
======
Suggested Resources Assuming No Prior Experience
------
------

The below sections outline my personal suggestions as to how to jump start a development career under the assumption that you (under the assumption that _you_ are the aspirant in question) have absolutely no prior experience. __Note:__ This guide is intended to make you job-market ready specifically, which includes an opinionated emphasis on web development first and a decided lack of coverage of less strictly necessary, more theoretical topics in computer science. In addition, the resources listed, particularly for community engagement, may only be regionally relevant to the Louisville area; in these cases the limitation should be obvious. Finally, all resources given have been chosen with great respect paid to cost, that is to say that free options are considered first, followed by low-cost and subscription options, and finally by high-cost and lump-payment options.

### What to Learn

The following subsections give a brief overview of your suggested ordered learning trajectory, some corresponding resources to accomplish this, and some guiding notes.

#### Trajectory

0. Foundational Topics<sup>1</sup>

    * git
    * Github
  * Programming fundamentals
    * Variables
    * Data Types
    * Arithmetic operators
    * Boolean logic
    * Data structures

  * <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/>
  * <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/>
  * <https://docs.python.org/3/>

#### Notes

<sup>1</sup> The foundational topics provided are _not_ intended to be learned as a true prerequisite to following items but rather __in conjunction with subsequent topics__. For instance, source control should be learned as needed while learning and coding for the front-end stack to manage projects from the start, and programming fundamentals start to be learned during the front-end exposure to JavaScript and reinforced and expanded upon during further programming language learning.

<sup>2</sup> Your language choice should match your coding interests, but each listed option has particular strengths for the first-time learner. JavaScript is advantageous in that you should already have experience using it after learning the front-end stack and allow you to really hone your skills. C# and Java are widely used by big businesses for development, with C# being the particular preference of Louisville-area firms and Java being the more prolific choice for firms across the world. Python is my pick for the easiest to grasp, the fastest for simpler prototyping, and the growing standard for teaching computer science (supplanting C and C++).
